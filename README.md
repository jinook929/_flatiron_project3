## How To Set Up the App

1. Visit my [Github repository](https://github.com/jinook929/_flatiron_project3) and clone the code to your local directory:

 `git clone https://github.com/jinook929/_flatiron_project3.git`

2. Enter into the *_flatiron_project3* folder: `cd _flatiron_project3`.
3. Execute `bundle install` and run `rails s` in terminal.
4. Then, open your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## How To Use the App

1. You can either sign up for your own account or use the existing accounts to log in (You can also sign in via your Google account).
2. Before logging in, you still can see evnet list and some informational pages, but you are unable to make reservations.
3. If you log in as normal user (`test@users.com`, password: 123), you can create, update, and delete your own registration.
4. If you log in as admin user (`abc@users.com`, password: 123), you can read, create, update, and delete events and users.
6. Each user has access to his/her own profile (user info, registered event info, edit profile option and password change) through the link on the navbar.
7. Event list can be categorized by onsite and virtual.
